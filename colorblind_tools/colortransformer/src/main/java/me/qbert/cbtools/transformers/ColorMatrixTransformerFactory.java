ColorMatrix? Nope, won't work.
You're right, the ColorMatrix version is very simplified, and not accurate. I created that color matrix one night (http://www.colorjack.com/labs/colormatrix/)
and since then it's shown up many places... I should probably take that page down before it spreads more! Anyways, it gives you an idea of what it might look
like, but for the real thing...
As far as a simple script to simulate color blindness, this one does the best job:
http://www.nofunc.com/Color_Blindness_Library/ â€” It uses "confusion lines" within the XYZ color space to calculate values (this one is in Javascript, and should be easy to convert to python).
There are a few other methods, and no one really knows exactly what it would look like... these are all generalizations of a small sample, set against the masses.
